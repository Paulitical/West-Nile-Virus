## Introduction


Due to the recent epidemic of West Nile Virus in the Windy City, the Department of Public Health set up a surveillance and control system. I am hoping it will let me learn something from the mosquito population as we collect data over time. Pesticides are a necessary evil in the fight for public health and safety, not to mention expensive! I need to derive an effective plan to deploy pesticides throughout the city!

## Dataset

The dataset, along with description, can be found here: [https://www.kaggle.com/c/predict-west-nile-virus/](https://www.kaggle.com/c/predict-west-nile-virus/).

# Process

**GitHub Repo**

1. Create a GitHub repository.
2. Retrieve the dataset and upload it into a directory named `assets`.
3. Generate a .py or .ipynb file that imports the available data.


**EDA**

Exploratoy Data Analysis is the single most important part of data science. This is where I spent most of your time. Knowing the data you are working with, and understanding the status of its integrity is the difference between a good model and a great model.

**Modeling**

My goals are to build a model and make predictions that the city of Chicago can use when it decides where to spray pesticides! 

After modeling conduct a cost-benefit analysis, including annual cost projections for various levels of pesticide coverage (cost) and the effect of these various levels of pesticide coverage (benefit). And lastly submit my predition to Kaggle to see how well I can predcit West Nile.
